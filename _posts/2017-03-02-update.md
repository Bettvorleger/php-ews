The first release candidate for 1.0.0 has just been published. You can find the
release on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.1). If you
are using composer, you should be able to simply run `composer update`. If you
have pinned the library to a specific version, you will have to update that
first.

Any issues should be reported on the
[issue queue](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/issues). Please complete
the issue template in full when reporting new issues.

Once I feel the library is stable, I will cut a stable release.

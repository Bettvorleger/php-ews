The documentation for the 0.1 version has been moved to it's new home at
<http://jamesarmes.com/php-ews/0.1> and the wiki has been updated to point
at this page. The wiki will be disabled once I feel that enough time has passed,
as the project repository has been updated with the new site as well.

The psr-4 branch has now been merged into master and all future development will
occur there. To follow along with the development of the 1.0 version, please see
the [milestone](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/milestone/2) in github.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
Packagist will be updated to point at master rather than composer on September
20, 2016. If you are currently building with composer, this WILL affect you.
Please begin to update your application to function with the current development
code in master, as this will be the foundation for version 1.0.

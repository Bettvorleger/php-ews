The 1.0 version is finally starting to come together. All classes have now been
namespaced and composer.json has been created. These changes have been made to
the psr-4 branch, but will be merged into the master branch shortly.

If you are currently using the library via composer, then you have been working
with the composer branch. There are some significant differences between the
two. Once packagist is updated, your software will likely break if you do not
update your code to match these changes.

All documentation will be moved to this new site. The existed wiki will be
removed and its documentation will be retained here, along with documentation
for the new version. All future updates will also be reported here.

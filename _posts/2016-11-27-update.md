A number of big changes to announce as the 1.0 version draws nearer.

* Packagist has been updated to point at the master branch. I have retained the
composer branch for those that still have yet to make the switch; however, it
will be removed at the end of the year. If you have not moved to the master
branch, I suggest you do so ASAP. You can use composer to pin a specific SHA
using `"dev-master#SHA"`.
* All operations available in Exchange Server 2010-2013 have been added to the
client. In addition, some properties that were introduced in Exchange 2016 have
been added; however, due to the current lack of documentation, Exchange 2016
support is not complete.
* A class map has been added for responses. As a result, the return value of
operations from the client will now use the correct class rather than being an
instance of `stdClass`.
* A few typos in constant names have been fixed. This may affect you if you are
currently using a misspelled constant.

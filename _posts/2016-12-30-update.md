The first beta of 1.0.0 has been released! You can find the release on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.1) and
you can update your composer to reference the new version. You can follow the
1.0.0 version with composer, so that it will be updated on `composer update`
without having to constantly update the version by using
`"php-ews/php-ews": "~1.0.0"`.

Any issues with the latest release should be reported in the
[issue queue](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/issues). If you haven't
already noticed, you will find that there is now a template for new issues.
Please be sure to complete the appropriate sections as best as possible to
ensure that you obtain the fastest support possible for your issue.

Once there have been no new issues for the beta for two weeks, an RC version
will be cut.

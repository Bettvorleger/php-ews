Once again, I find myself apologizing for the delay. As it often does, life has
gotten in the way, but I've found some time to review recent issues and ensure
that there are no major issues that would prevent a release. Which leads me to
the purpose of this update.

Version 1.0.0 of php-ews has been released and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/releases/tag/1.0.0). If you are
using composer, can run `composer update`. Version 1.0.0 of php-ntlm has also
been released. If you have set the `minimum-stability` option in your
composer.json you may now remove it.

This release is largely identical to the latest release candidate, including
only documentation changed. Any issues should be reported on the
[issue queue](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/issues). Please complete
the issue template in full when reporting new issues.
